You need to have ocaml properly downloaded and the ANSITerminal package by running "opam install ANSITerminal".

Download the source code. You will need to run "dune build" before running the code.
Go into the directory of the code, "ludo/", and then run "make play". 

The game will now begin.

For those who don't know how to play ludo: you need to roll a 6 before you can 
move any of your pieces.
